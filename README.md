Topic models
============

This repository has the implementations of different topic models 
such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process.


Latent Dirichlet Allocation
----------------------------------
Please see the project **ldamcmc**





Hierarchical Dirichlet Process
------------------------------
This module was originally implemented by [Chong Wang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chongw).
To see the latest code, please go to his [website](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chongw/resource.html). 
This is based on the split-merge implementation of the HDP Gibbs smapler. 





---------------------------------------------

Some of the modules are copied directly from different 
authors and all rights are with them. I'm keeping here to track 
the customizations that I made on their source code.
