Topic models
============

This repository has the implementations of different topic models 
such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process.


Latent Dirichlet Allocation (ldahp)
----------------------------------
This module has the implementations of different Gibbs samplers (full and collapsed) of 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and parameter estimation of the LDA Dirichlet 
hyperparameters. Everything is implemented as an R package.    





Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (hdp)
------------------------------
This module is an implementation by [Chong Wang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chongw).
To see latest code, please go to his [website](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chongw/resource.html). 
This is based on the split-merge implementation of HDP Gibbs smapler. 






---------------------------------------------

Some of the modules are copied directly from different 
authors and all credits go to them. I'm keeping here to track 
the customizations made on their source code.
