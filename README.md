Topic models
============

This repository has the implementations of different topic models 
such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process.


Latent Dirichlet Allocation
----------------------------------
This contains the implementations of different Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Gibbs samplers (*full* and *collapsed*) and Dirichlet hyperparameter selection. 
The respective source modules are the following
* ***ldahp*** is an R package for the LDA Gibbs samplers and hyperparameter estimation procedure   
* ***ldahp-r*** contains the R implementations of the Gibbs samplers and hyperparameter estimation procedure  





Hierarchical Dirichlet Process
------------------------------
This module was originally implemented by [Chong Wang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chongw).
To see latest code, please go to his [website](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chongw/resource.html). 
This is based on the split-merge implementation of HDP Gibbs smapler. 
* ***hdp*** 





---------------------------------------------

Some of the modules are copied directly from different 
authors and all rights are with them. I'm keeping here to track 
the customizations that I made on their source code.
