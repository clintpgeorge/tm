The Whales-Tires Dataset
------------------------

This is a topic modeling dataset created from a sub set of the 
Wikipedia articles under the Wikipedia categories Whales and Tires. 
The articles were downloaded in Fall 2010. 


Contents
-------- 

docs					: 	This folder contains the downloaded 
							Wikipedia articles (each article's a 
							few initial paragraphs are scraped) 
							in plain text format 

whales-tires.index		: 	Every line of this file represents the 
							index of a file in the docs folder. 
							Each line has - the document id; the 
							Wikipedia article's sub category; the 
							Wikipedia article's heading; the number 
							of unique words in the document (based 
							on the corpus vocabulary); the document 
							length 

whales-tires.ldac.vocab	: 	This file has all the unique terms in 
							the corpus vocabulary. The corpus 
							vocabulary is created after performing 
							the steps described below. 

							1. We tokenized the words in every 
							corpus document using the Python NLTK 
							regular expression-based tokenizer. We 
							used a custom made regular expression 
							for tokenization.  
							2. We removed stop words from each 
							document's word tokens using a 
							predefined stop word list 
							3. We discarded tokens of length < 2 and 
							> 20
							4. We discarded tokens of total 
							frequency in the corpus < 5
							5. We discarded numerical values, dates, 
							and times from each document's word 
							tokens  

whales-tires.ldac		: 	Every line of this file represents a 
							document from the 'docs' folder in the 
							LDA-c format. The LDA-c format is 
							described below 

							[M] [term_1]:[count] [term_2]:[count] ...  [term_N]:[count]

							[M] represents the number of unique 
							terms in the document 

							[count] represents each term [term_i]'s 
							relative frequency in the document. 

							[term_i] represents the vocabulary id of 
							term i in the document
