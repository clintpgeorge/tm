docs                         : This folder contains the Wikipedia articles (each article's 
                               a few initial paragraphs are scraped) downloaded from the 
                               Whales and Tires category in plain text format 

whales-tires.index           : Every line of this file represents the index of a file 
                               in the docs folder. Each line contains - document id; 
                               the Wikipedia articles' sub category; the Wikipedia article heading; 
                               the number of unique words in the document; 
                               the document length 

whales-tires.ldac.vocab      : This file has all the unique terms in the corpus 
                               vocabulary. The corpus vocabulary is created after 
                               performing the steps described below. 

                               1. Tokenized the words in every corpus document 
                               using the Python NLTK regular expression-based 
                               tokenizer. We used a custom made regular expression 
                               for tokenization.  
                               2. Removed stop words from each document's word tokens 
                               using a predefined stop word list 
                               3. Discarded tokens of length < 2 and > 20
                               4. Discarded tokens of total frequency in the corpus < 5
                               5. Discarded numerical values, dates, and times from each 
                               document's word tokens  

whales-tires.ldac            : Every line of this file represents a document from 
                               the 'docs' folder in the LDA-c format. 
                       
                               [M] [term_1]:[count] [term_2]:[count] ...  [term_N]:[count]

                               [M] represents the number of unique terms in the document 

                               [count] represents each term [term_i] 's relative frequency 
                               in the document. 

                               [term_i] represents the vocabulary id of term i in the document
