A spare tire is an additional tire (or tyre - see spelling differences) carried in a motor vehicle as a replacement for one that goes flat, a blowout, or other emergency. Spare tire is generally a misnomer, as almost all vehicles actually carry an entire wheel as a spare, as fitting a tire to a wheel is very difficult without specialised equipment, and is not practical in an emergency. However, some spare tires ("space-saver" and "donut" types) are not meant to be driven long distances and most of them have maximum speed of around 50 mph (80 km/h).
The early days of motor travel took place on primitive roads that were littered with stray horseshoe nails. Punctures (flat tires) were all too common, and required the motorist to remove the wheel from the car, demount the tire, patch the inner tube, re-mount the tire, inflate the tire, and re-mount the wheel. The first to equip cars with a spare wheel-and-tire assembly were the Ramblers made by Thomas B. Jeffery Company. The Rambler's interchangeable wheel and mounted spare tire meant the motorist could quickly exchange it for the flat one. The punctured tire could then be repaired at a more convenient time and place.
The pre-mounted spare tire and wheel combination proved so popular with motorists that carrying up to two spare tires became common. Automakers often equipped cars with one or dual sidemounts. The spares were mounted behind the front fenders as they blended into the running boards (a narrow footboard serving as a step beneath the doors).
In 1941, the U.S. government prohibited spare tires on new cars. Shortages of resources caused by World War II led to quotas and laws designed to force conservation, including rubber that was produced overseas and difficult to get. A similar ban was also implemented by the U.S. during the Korean War in 1951.[1]
Contemporary vehicles may come equipped with full-size spares, limited use minispares, or have run-flat capability.[2]
