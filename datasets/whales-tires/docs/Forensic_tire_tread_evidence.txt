Forensic tire tread evidence records and analyzes impressions of vehicle tire treads for use in legal proceedings to help prove the identities of persons at the crime scene. Every tire will show different amounts of tread wear, different amounts of damage in the form of tiny cuts and nicks. These unique characteristics will also show on the impression left by the tire.

This forensic technique was first invented in 1930 by David Chapman, a researcher affiliated with the Sheriff's Office in Los Angeles, California, in the United States.[1]
