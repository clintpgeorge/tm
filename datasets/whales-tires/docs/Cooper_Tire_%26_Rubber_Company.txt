The earliest corporate lineage for Cooper Tire was the M and M Company, which was formed by two brothers-in-law in Akron, Ohio in 1914, a company that made tire repair materials.[2] That company later acquired the Giant Tire and Rubber Company and moved to Findlay, Ohio at a site at the intersection of Lima and Western Avenue still occupied by Cooper Tire and adjacent to The Cooper Corporation facilities. The Cooper name originates from 1919 with the establishment of The Cooper Corporation in 1919 located in Findlay, Ohio when Cincinnati auto parts dealer I.J. Cooper formed the company to manufacture new tires. The Cooper Corporation, the M and M Company, and The Falls Rubber company merged in 1930 to form the Master Tire and Rubber Company. The company name was changed to Cooper Tire and Rubber Company in 1946.[3]
In 1941, the first year the Cooper oval trademark with the Cooper Knight head gear was registered and used. In those early years of the brand's identification, the logo also included a banner proclaiming the tires' "armored-cord" construction. The company's red, white, and blue logo would become one of the most easily recognized emblems in the tire industry.
