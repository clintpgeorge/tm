The Dwarf Killer Whale is a type of Orca found in Antarctic waters believed by some scientists to be a distinct species from the larger Orca found throughout the world's oceans. Primarily eating fish rather than mammals, this ecotype averages less than 6 meters in length.
Robert L. Pitman describes using aerial photogrammetry to determine the size of numerous Type C killer whales, supporting earlier Soviet research which suggested that one or possibly two distinct species of orca exist in the southern ocean.[1][2]
