Fountain Tire was founded by Bill Fountain in 1956 and began as a small double-bay garage in Wainwright, Alberta. With its head office now in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Fountain Tire operates over 140 stores across Canada, spanning from Victoria, British Columbia to Vaughan, Ontario. The company was under Bill Fountain’s leadership for 20 years and expanded to 19 stores before a car accident claimed his life in 1976.
In 1987 Fountain Tire formed a business partnership with Goodyear (increasing the number of stores from 19 stores to 30). On September 24, 1987, Fountain Tire sold 49% of its business interest to Goodyear Canada. By the end of the 1990s, Fountain Tire had added over 100 new stores in Canada, as far East as Vaughan, Ontario. Fountain Tire’s head office changed its role from that of a retail goods supplier to a central resource centre and began providing partnership support in areas such as purchasing, training, accounting, insurance, legal services, and marketing to its stores. Fountain Tire has been one of the “50 Best Managed Companies” in Canada every year since 1994 becoming a Platinum Club Member in 2003.
Fountain Tire allows managers employed at Fountain Tire stores the opportunity to own part of the business and become 50/50 partners in their store. The company’s mission is to “create opportunities that enable its employees to satisfy customer needs with integrity.”
