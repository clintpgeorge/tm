Cetotherium (meaning whale beast) is a genus of the extinct cetaceans from the family Cetotheriidae (the cetotheriids or cetotheres).[1]
To date, several whales of the genus Cetotherium have been identified; C. furlongi, C. mayeri, C. megalophysum, C. parvum, C. priscum, and C. rathkii.
Cetotheres came in to existence during the Oligocene epoch. The cetotheres have been divided in to two sub-groups. One group includes Cetotherium. From evolutionary perspective, these whales share some characteristics of the Balaenopteridae and Eschrichtiidae.[2]
Fossil records of Cetotheriids indicate that these whales were attacked and preyed upon by large predatory sharks (e.g. megalodon and great white sharks).
