Understeer and oversteer are vehicle dynamics terms used to describe the sensitivity of a vehicle to steering. Automotive engineers originally defined understeer and oversteer based on the gradient of the steering needed to make a turn in a steady-state condition (constant speed, constant radius) on a flat and level ground surface. Car and motorsport enthusiasts often use the terminology more generally in magazines and web blogs to describe vehicle response to steering in all kinds of maneuvers, even on banked turns. In the popular usage, a vehicle that is less responsive to steering might be called understeer or "tight" or "plowing"; a vehicle that is more responsive to steering is sometimes called oversteer or "loose" or "free".
In standard terminology defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J670[1] and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 8855[2], understeer and oversteer are based on differences in steady-state conditions where the vehicle is following a constant-radius path at a constant speed with a constant steering wheel angle, on a flat and level surface. If the speed is increased slightly for the same radius path and, after settling into steady state, the same steering is measured, then the vehicle is said to have neutral steer. If more steering is needed at the higher speed to maintain the same radius of curvature, then the vehicle is said to have understeer. If less steering is needed at the higher speed, then the vehicle is said to have oversteer.
