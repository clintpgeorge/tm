A bottlenose whale is either of two species of whale, members of the ziphiid family. The two species—the northern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon ampullatus and the southern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon planifrons—are the sole members of the Hyperoodon genus. Whilst they are physically similar their stories over the past two hundred years are rather different. The southern bottlenose has been rarely observed, was seldom hunted, and is probably the most abundant whale in Antarctic waters. The northern species on the other hand was hunted heavily by Norway and Britain in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
The two species are fairly rotund and measure 8–10 metres (26–33 ft) in length when adult. The melon is extremely bluff. The beak is long and white on males but grey on females. The dorsal fin is relatively small at 30–38 centimetres (12–15 in) and set behind the middle of the back. It is falcate (sickle-shaped) and usually tipped. The back is mid-to-dark grey in the Northern species and light-to-mid grey in the Southern. Both species have a lighter underside.
Weight estimates are hard to come by. For the northern bottlenose whale, 5,800–7,500 kilograms (13,000–17,000 lb) is given somewhat consistently.[1][2] For the southern bottlenose whale, there is a single figure of 6–8 tonnes.[3]
The northern bottlenose whale is endemic to the North Atlantic Ocean and is found in cool and subarctic waters such as the Davis Strait, the Labrador Sea, the Greenland Sea and the Barents Sea. They prefer deep water. The total population is unknown but likely to be of the order of 10,000. "The Gully", a huge submarine canyon east of Nova Scotia, has a year-round population of around 160 whales.
The southern bottlenose whale has a circumpolar distribution in the Southern Ocean. It is found as far south as the Antarctic coast and as north as the tip of South Africa, New Zealand's North Island and the southern parts of Brazil. The global population is unknown.
