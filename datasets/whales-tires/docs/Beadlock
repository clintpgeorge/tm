A beadlock or bead lock is a mechanical device that secures the bead of a tire to the wheel of a vehicle. Tires and wheels are designed so that, when the tire is inflated, the tire pressure pushes the bead of the tire against the inside of the wheel rim so that the tire stays on the wheel and the two rotate together. In situations where tire pressure is insufficient to hold the bead of the tire in place, a beadlock is needed.
There are several styles of beadlocks. For 4-wheel drive vehicles, a ring with a number of bolts around the circumference is used to clamp the tire to the wheel. For motorcycles, a rim lock or bead stopper is a curved plate tightened by a single bolt. For both 4-wheel drive vehicles and motorcycles, a different style of beadlock can be used that is similar to an inner tube which is inflated to press the tire against the wheel.
Bead lock may also refer to a product used to secure a swimming pool liner into the pool liner track installed on many above ground pools. It has a wedge shaped edge on the front of the strip. When installing the strip, it inserts just above the pool liner bead. It then locks the liner into the receiving track.
Dodge Military trucks had the first beadlocks, called Combat Wheels; The 'combat wheels' were a divided-rim, that used a bolted-on retaining ring replacing the normal split ring wheels. They were designed for quick and easy tire replacement during combat, hence the name.
First manufactured for aftermarket racing and off road applications by Marsh Racing Wheels at Siloam Springs, Arkansas in 1980 but conceived, designed and tested by Marsh Racing Wheels years earlier.[citation needed]
