Balaenoptera brydei is a species of cetacean, marine mammals, in a complex group known as the Bryde’s Whales. They are the least-known and in many ways the most unusual of the rorquals. They are small by rorqual standards—no more than about 25 tonnes—prefer tropical and temperate waters to the polar seas that other whales in their family frequent; are largely coastal rather than pelagic, and although they retain the characteristic plates of whalebone that the Mysticeti use to sieve small creatures from the waters with, their diet is composed almost entirely of fish.
The Bryde’s whale is named for the Norwegian consul to South Africa, Johan Bryde, who helped set up the first whaling station in Durban, South Africa in 1908.
Bryde’s whales feed on pelagic schooling fish, such as anchovy, herring and sardine.
They are distributed widely throughout tropical and subtropical waters, with a separate, smaller, pygmy species found in tropical Western Pacific and South-East Asia.
The population currently described as Balaenoptera brydei is part of a group with taxonomic confusion resulting from disputed systematics and misidentification, sometimes termed the Balaenoptera edeni complex after the early description Balaenoptera edeni Anderson, 1879. The group are very similar in appearance to Sei Whales (Balaenoptera borealis), and almost as large, and commercial whaling harvests termed all these as Bryde's whale until the 1970s. Specimens of Balaenoptera omurai have also been identified by the common name 'Bryde's whale'. The taxa are poorly known and further research is required to resolve the arrangements of these sister groups.[2]
