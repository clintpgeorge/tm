Orcas (killer whales) are powerful predators capable of dispatching prey much larger than humans, such as leopard seals and great white sharks. They have also been recorded preying on usually terrestrial species such as moose swimming between islands.[1] However, wild orcas are not usually considered a threat to humans, as there are few documented cases of wild orcas attacking people. There have been about two dozen cases of orcas attacking humans since the 1970s,[2] almost exclusively perpetrated by captive animals. Experts are divided as to whether the injuries and deaths caused by captive killer whales have been accidents or deliberate attempts to cause harm.[3]
August 2005, while swimming in 4 feet of water in Helm Bay, near Ketchikan, a 12 year old boy named Ellis Miller was "bumped" in the shoulder by a 25 foot transient killer whale. The boy was not bitten or injured in any way.[4]

There are no documented cases of killer whales attacking and killing humans in the wild.[4]
A video purporting to show a Korean in a kayak being capsized by a jumping orca and surviving was in fact a fake, being originally made for a commercial for an energy drink.[5]
In 1968, the young female orca, Lupa, of the New York Aquarium chased her trainers out of the tank, snapping her jaws threateningly. Trainers were cleaning the tank at the time of the incident.[6]
