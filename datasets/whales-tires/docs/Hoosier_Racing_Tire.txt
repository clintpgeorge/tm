Hoosier Racing Tire is an American tire manufacturer primarily specializing in the production of tires for competition use. An Indiana based company, Hoosier claims to be the world's largest race tire manufacturer. The company was founded in 1958, and has since provided tires for use in series sanctioned by IHRA, ARCA, CRA, NASCAR, IMCA, WISSOTA, SCCA and Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series. Indiana native Tony Stewart has stated that he would feel safer driving on reliable Hoosier tires, as opposed to NASCAR's current tire provider, Goodyear.[1]
