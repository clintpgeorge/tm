A radial tire (more properly, a radial-ply tire) is a particular design of automotive tire (in British English, tyre).
The first radial tire designs were patented in 1915 by Arthur W. Savage, a successful tire manufacturer and inventor in San Diego, CA.	 [1] Savage's patents expired in 1949. The design was further developed and widely commercialized by Michelin in 1946, [1]. Because of its advantages, it has now become the standard design for essentially all automotive tires.
Tires are not fabricated just from rubber. They would be far too flexible and weak. Within the rubber are a series of plies of cord that act as reinforcement. All common tires (since at least the 1960s) are made of layers of rubber and cords of polyester, steel, and/or other textile materials. This network of cords that gives the tire strength and shape is called the carcass.
