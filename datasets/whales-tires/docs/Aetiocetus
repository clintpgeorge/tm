Aetiocetus is an extinct genus of baleen whale that lived 25 million years ago, in the Oligocene period. Its fossils have been found in the North Pacific,[1] around Oregon. It was first named by Douglas Emlong in 1966 and currently contains four species, A cotylalveus, A. polydentatus, A. tomitai, and A. weltoni.
Aetiocetus is a transitional fossil between early whales and the modern whales, its blowhole being located halfway up its snout rather than at the top of its head.[2] It is also one of the earliest-known baleen whales.[3] The genus, though more cranially reminiscent of archaic whales, with its pronounced snout and flat cranium,[4] had a loose jaw like later baleen whales.[3]Aetiocetus skulls have also shown that the animal bore a full set of teeth,[3][5] as well as baleen.[4][6] The skulls contain about forty-four teeth,[7] which consist of cusped molars, curved canines, and incisors.[4]Aetiocetus most likely fed on fish and crustaceans.[4]
Douglas Emlong originally classified it in the extinct whale suborder Archaeoceti,[8][9] because of its teeth. However, when Van Valen analyzed it in 1968, he moved the genus to the suborder Mysticeti due to its derived pattern of bone telescoping.[9]

A. tomitai, Barnes, Kimura, Furusawa & Sawamura, 1995
A. weltoni, Barnes, Kimura, Furusawa & Sawamura, 1995. An analysis of this species revealed that there were similar palatal nutrient foramina to those which house vessels which feed modern genera of mysticetes.[6]
