Plus sizing is the practice of changing a specific tire to a larger size while compensating with reductions in other aspects of the tire's size so that the new tire has the same diameter and circumference as the original tire to prevent any changes in speedometer accuracy, torque and traction control.
The number following the "plus" describes the number of inches which is added to the diameter of the rim. For example, plus one sizing means increasing the wheel by one inch.
A plus zero upgrade means changing to a wider tire size while using the same diameter wheel.
Changing to a wider tire requires reducing the aspect ratio (the second number in the sequence of numbers that describes the tire's size). Since the aspect ratio is a percentage which is used to calculate the height of the tire's sidewall, if follows that if a larger number is used for the width, a smaller number must be substituted if the final result is to remain the same—which is the objective of Plus sizing.
These are simply examples and do not represent all of the possible combinations which could achieve the same result. For an R16 tire, 205/60, 225/55, 245/50 and 275/45 width/aspect ratio tires have essentially the same diameter.
