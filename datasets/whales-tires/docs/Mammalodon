Mammalodon is an extinct genus of whale that was discovered in 1932. It is an early baleen whale which still had teeth, as opposed to baleen plates.[1] It is one of two genera in the family Mammalodontidae.
Modern whales have numerous plates with frayed edges called whalebones (or baleen). The whale ingests a mouthful of water then filters prey (such as krill) through the baleen.
Mammalodon, with a length of 2.5m, was smaller and more basal than modern baleen whales.[2] It had a short face, a delicate Premaxilla with only one or two incisors and the lateral rim of the internal auditory meatus was lengthened towards the brain case which formed a longitudinal ridge. Unlike modern baleen whales, Mammalodon was endowed with well developed teeth.
As with the closely related genus Janjucetus, Mammalodon lacked baleen, instead possessing well developed teeth.[1] As such, it was not able to filter-feed in the same manner as extant baleen whales, making its diet and ecological niche a mystery.[1] As the teeth are widely spaced, it has been suggested that they may have developed a method of filter-feeding unlike that of other whales.[3] It is hypothosised that it was a bottom filter feeder, its blunt snout helping to suck up organisms from the sea floor.[4]
