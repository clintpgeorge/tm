A tire-pressure monitoring system (TPMS) is an electronic system designed to monitor the air pressure inside the pneumatic tires on various types of vehicles. The system is also sometimes referred to as a tire-pressure indication system (TPIS). These systems report real-time tire-pressure information to the driver of the vehicle, either via a gauge, a pictogram display, or a simple low-pressure warning light.
Direct-sensor TPMSes employ physical pressure sensors inside or outside each tire and a means of processing and sending that information to the vehicle's instrument cluster. These systems can identify simultaneous under-inflation in all four tires in any combination.
Direct-sensor TPMS are specifically designed to cope with ambient and road-to-tire friction-based temperature changes[citation needed], both of which heat up the tire, and increase its pressure. The alarm-activation threshold pressures are usually set according to the manufacturers recommended "cold placard inflation pressures".
In order to transfer data from a rotating wheel, a direct-sensor system may use a radio-frequency (RF) communication channel or electromagnetic coupling to overcome the tire/chassis rotational boundary.
The pressure sensor devices used in direct-sensor TPMS can be installed inside the tire (internal sensor) or mounted on the valve stem (external sensor). Internal sensors have to be fitted to the wheel rim as the tire is fitted, whereas external sensors are simply screwed onto the valve in place of the regular valve dust cap, making them suitable as an after-market accessory that can be fitted and maintained by the user.
