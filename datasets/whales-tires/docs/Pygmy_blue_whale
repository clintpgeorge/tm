The pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) is a subspecies of the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) found in the Indian Ocean and the southern Pacific Ocean.
Reaching lengths of 24 metres (79 ft) it is smaller than the other commonly recognized subspecies, B. m. musculus and B. m. intermedia, which reach 29 m (95 ft) in length, hence its common name.[3]
According to observations made since the subspecies was first described in 1966, the pygmy blue whale differs from the "true" blue whales in a number of physical characteristics. It has:
broader and shorter baleen plates,
a shorter tail, and hence a proportionately longer body in front of the dorsal fin, and
a larger head relative to body size.

The shorter tail gives the pygmy blue whale more of a tadpole-like shape, and reflects in differences in diving behaviour: whereas in the "true" blues, there is a delay between the submergence of the dorsal fin and the caudal peduncle; in pygmy blue whales, the dorsal and peduncle submerge simultaneously. Pygmy blue whales also tend to be darker than the other subspecies of blue whales, and the shape of their blowhole is different.[3][4]
