Tubeless tyres are pneumatic tyres that do not require a separate butyl rubber inner tube.
Traditional designs of pneumatic tyres required a separate inner tube which could fail for a number of reasons, such as: incorrect tyre fitment, or friction between the tyre wall and inner tube generating excess heat causing a blowout.
Tubeless tyre technology does away with the need for an inner tube thereby increasing safety.
In a tubeless tyre, the tyre, which has an inner lining of impermeable halobutyl, and the rim of the wheel form an airtight seal, with the valve being directly mounted on the rim.
If a tubeless tyre gets punctured, air escapes only through the hole, leading to a gentle deflation of the tyre. Conversely, an inner tube could potentially burst like a balloon, leading to a rapid deflation of the tyre which could result in sudden loss of control of the vehicle. A liquid tyre sealant can be added to tubeless tyres to prevent deflation. Additionally, it is easier to mend a tubeless tyre puncture using an easy-to-use puncture kit.
