Dunlop Rubber was a company based in the United Kingdom which manufactured tyres and other rubber products for most of the 20th century. It was taken over by BTR plc in 1985. Since then, ownership of the Dunlop brands has been fragmented.
The company traced its origins to 1889, when Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd was formed in Oriel House, Dublin to acquire and commercialise John Dunlop's patent for pneumatic tyres.[1] This was the period of the bicycle boom. In 1896 the company registered a trademark[2] and incorporated a subsidiary in England[3]. Initially the company subcontracted manufacture, but by 1902 it had its own manufacturing subsidiary, Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd, in Birmingham, England.
In the early 1890s Dunlop established branches in Europe, North America and Australia. Although the pneumatic tyre was successful, Dunlop ran into financial difficulties, and had to sell its overseas operations. A significant disposal was the sale of the Australian branch in 1899. Since then, Dunlop Australia has not been connected with the British company, except for a 25% share in Dunlop Australia owned by the British company from 1927 to 1984. As a result, the rights to the Dunlop brands in Australia and New Zealand have been under different ownership from those in the rest of the world.[4]
In 1900 the company started production of tyres for motor cars. The company continued its expansion, and in 1918 production started at the new plant at Fort Dunlop, Birmingham. By 1920 the company had selling subsidiaries or branches in South Africa, South America, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and India, manufacturing operations in France, Japan and the USA, and rubber plantations in Malaya and Ceylon.
In the 1920s, competition from foreign companies intensified in the UK tyre market, and Dunlop diversified. In 1925 Dunlop acquired the Charles Mackintosh group, and the Dunlop name was applied to footwear and clothing.
