Balaenoptera omurai is a species of whale about which almost nothing is known.
The scientific description of this whale was made in the November 20, 2003, edition of Nature (426, 278-281) by three Japanese scientists Shiro Wada, Masayuki Oishi and Tadasu K. Yamada. The three scientists determined the existence of the species by analysing the morphology and mitochondrial DNA of nine individuals—eight caught by a Japanese research vessel in the late 1970s in the Indo-Pacific and a further specimen collected in 1998 from a small island in the Sea of Japan. B. omurai resembles the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in external appearance, but is smaller.[2][3]
Whether the claim of a new species will be accepted by the wider cetological community remains to be seen.[4] Indeed other scientists were cautious in their immediate response to the announcement of the discovery. Quoted in the The New York Times, Dr. Howard C. Rosenbaum, a conservation biologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, said the Japanese researchers had done "an admirable job to at least open the question as whether this is a distinct species," but added that more DNA analysis needed to be done.[5]
The specific epithet commemorates Japanese cetologist Hideo Omura, thus a common name for the accepted species would be Omura's Whale.[2]
In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World, the "species" is relegated to being a synonym of Balaenoptera edeni. However the authors note that this subject to a revision of the genus.[6] The database ITIS lists this as a valid taxon, noting a caveat on the disputed systematics of this species, Balaenoptera edeni and Balaenoptera brydei.[7]
