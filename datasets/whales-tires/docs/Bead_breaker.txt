A bead breaker is a tool used for separating tires from rims. The inside ring of the tire is called the lip, and the bead on the lip seals to the rim in a radial-ply tire trapping air inside. Often, the bead can become frozen to the rim after rusting occurs requiring the use of a bead breaker and usually a base upon which the wheel is mounted.
A bead breaker was designed and developed and patented by Guy Boardman a resident of South Africa in 2005. As an avid 4x4 enthusiast and overland traveller a need was experienced for a simple tool to effectively and efficiently remove the tire from the rim of wheel, in those cases where a tire requires repairs to the inside of the tyre carcass.
Overland and expedition travellers almost universally carry the Hi-Lift Jack, made by the Hi-Lift Jack Company, whose parent company, The Bloomfield Manufacturing Company, was established in Indiana in 1895. The principal market and use of the Hi-Lift Jack today, is within the worldwide 4x4 community where the Hi-Lift Jack is one of the most versatile tools that can be used to extricate a stuck vehicle, through lifting, pushing, pulling, clamping or winching. There are however a multitude of other uses for the Hi-Lift Jack.
A requirement for overland and expedition travellers, due to the constraints of space and weight is to utilise tools that are multi-purpose and with this in mind the Bead Breaker bolts to the foot of the Hi-Lift Jack, to create the mechanical advantage required to remove the tyre from the rim.
The flat tyre is placed beneath a suitable jacking point on a vehicle with the Bead Breaker carefully positioned on top of the flat tire, snug up against the rime and by operating the Hi-Lift, against the weight of the vehicle, the bead of the tire is forced from the rim.
