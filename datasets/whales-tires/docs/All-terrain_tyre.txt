An all-terrain tyre is a type of automotive tyre most commonly found on four-wheel drive vehicles.
The all-terrain tyre is intended to provide a good compromise between off-road capability and on-road manners. Since manufacturers are aware of the fact that the majority of SUVs and other four-wheel drive vehicles will never stray very far from public roads, the tyres they are fitted with as standard tend to be biased towards road use. That is to say that for highway driving in a variety of conditions, they will offer good traction and low noise levels.
The all-terrain tyre was also know to have a fault in it: the weak sidewall. BF Goodrich fixed this problem by using a Tri guard 3 Ply sidewall in their all-terrain tyres.
