Coker Tire Company is a Chattanooga, Tennessee-based company that manufactures and sells obsolete Michelin, Firestone, BF Goodrich and US Royal bias-ply and radial whitewall tires for collector automobiles. Though the tires retain the appearance of the old tires, the tires are made with modern technology. Coker Tire was given manufacturing rights by the original tire brands and also has acquired many different tire molds of the original obsolete tires they manufacture. The company also has a facility in Fresno, California and over 30 distributors worldwide.
Coker Tire sells its own brand of whitewall bias and radial tires, and manufactures what they describe as the largest bicycle tire in the world, at 36 inches in diameter.[1]
At one time, Coker marketed the "Wheelman", a penny-farthing, with a 36-inch (910 mm) wheel in front and a 12-inch (300 mm) wheel behind, and for a short time in the 2000s, and again since June 2008, a cruiser-style bicycle with 36-inch (910 mm) wheels called the "Monster Cruiser".[2]
Coker sells, and as of March 2010, manufacturers a touring-style unicycle with a 36-inch (910 mm) wheel called "The Big One".[3]
